                    <h3>Impedance Control in Dual Robots</h3>
                    <p>This project involved connecting two KUKA LBR iiwa collaborative robots over a ROS network. The robots were controlled using custom implementation of impedance control written in C++. Through transformation of the robot bases and by using forward kinematics, the robots are commanded to minimize the relative distance between the end-effectors.</p>

                    <p>
                        This project developed an end-to-end motion planning pipeline that integrates RRT* as a global planner and Model Predictive Control (MPC) as a local planner for effective velocity obstacle avoidance. 
                        The system was implemented in Python and utilized the PyBullet physics engine to simulate various warehouse environments, allowing for comprehensive testing and validation of the planning algorithms.

                    <h3>Multi-Sensor Perception of Intelligent Vehicles</h3>
                    <p>
                        This project focuses on pedestrian and obstacle detection for intelligent vehicles using a combination of LiDAR, Radar, and camera data. The project included point cloud processing and clustering for efficient region proposals. The processed point cloud data was used as a prior to enhance the performance of a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification. Additionally, the iterative closest point (ICP) method was employed for ego-motion compensation of the vehicle through frame transformation.

                    <h3>Machine Learning for Autonomous Steering</h3>
                    <p>
                        This project involves developing an autonomous steering system using machine learning techniques. The task is framed as a classification problem within an autonomous racing game, where the agent learns driving policies from pixel observations. By leveraging imitation learning, the robot utilizes raw images as inputs. A feature extractor is designed to extract edge information from these images. The extracted features are then reduced in dimensionality through principal component analysis (PCA), resulting in a lower-dimensional feature vector that is resilient to background color variations and can generalize to new datasets.

                    <p>
                        The entire system is developed using Python, TensorFlow, and Gym for the simulation environment.

                    <p> This project implemented quadrotor control algorithms (linear PD controller V.S. non-linear geometric controller) for trajectory tracking tasks. Multiple reference trajectories were followed such as the Circle and Diamond trajectory. The algorithms have been implemented both in Matlab as in Python.</p>
